    "title": "This is Democracy Podcast",
    "description": "The future of democracy is uncertain, but we are committed to its urgent renewal today. This podcast will draw on historical knowledge to inspire a contemporary democratic renaissance. The past offers hope for the present and the future, if only we can escape the negativity of our current moment — and each show will offer a serious way to do that! This podcast will bring together thoughtful voices from different generations to help make sense of current challenges and propose positive steps forward. Our goal is to advance democratic change, one show at a time. Dr. Jeremi Suri, a renowned scholar of democracy, will host the podcast and moderate discussions. Zachary Suri will read an original poem for each episode and serve as co-host.\n\nThis is Democracy Podcasts, and related content can also be seen at our partner site, http://notevenpast.org.",
