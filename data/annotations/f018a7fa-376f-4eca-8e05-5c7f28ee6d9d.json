I just want you to know, I can see through your masks, you that never done nothing but build to destroy. You play with my world like it's your little toy. You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes and you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly. Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive a world war can be won. You want me to believe?

Some people sided enthusiastically with the United States. All the governments of Latin America voted unanimously in the Organization of American States to set up, to set up the quarantine and approve this idea that they didn't want nuclear weapons on Cuba. Pretty much everyone in the governments or in, you know, the executive branches of Latin American governments agreed on that. But when you look beyond that, there was a huge amount of disagreement about whether Cuba should be allowed to have these weapons. A lot of people argued that they were defensive weapons, just like Castro said that Cuba was clearly under attack and should have the right to defend itself, whereas other people said, No, you're increasing the danger for everyone in the hemisphere. This is unacceptable to have these weapons and you so you get divisions among Latin American countries and within Latin American countries, whereas you get huge protests. In contrast to what we see in the United States, there were a couple major peace protests, but in Latin America, they were huge, and they were all over the place, and in some cases, they devolved into riots, like in Bolivia, I was shocked to find out that more Bolivians died as a result of the Cuban missile crisis than Cubans, and that's because they also felt invested in the outcome, and it played the crisis, played into these existing divisions within Latin American societies like Bolivia, and kind of ignited the these conflicts that had been simmering for a long time."

We know more about what the United States was doing based on availability of us records, and they definitely were watching what was going on in Latin America. I read the Kennedy tapes, which was it's a transcription of secret recordings that Kennedy kept during his meetings in the White House during the Cuban Missile Crisis. It's an amazing resource. And in these meetings of the Executive Committee of the National Security Council or EXCOM, they were discussing what was going on in Latin America even before they decided to set up the quarantine, they were concerned. How is this going to look in Latin America? Are people going to see this as just the latest episode of US imperialism? Could the missiles in Cuba destabilize the balance of power in the region? Could it give Cuba like equal power as the United States, since they also would then have nuclear weaponry that they could use to kind of throw their weight around. And then during the crisis, they were discussing reactions in Latin America, and they were worried when they saw these riots and these very strong responses among Latin American publics against their own governments. They were worried about stability in Latin America, and worried that this crisis could spin out and destabilize countries like Mexico and Brazil and Bolivia. And so they were very closely following what was going on in Latin America. And then on the Soviet side, we do have evidence that they were also watching what was going on in Latin America, and they were aware of clearly, the OIS vote that had been all over the news. And they also knew which OAS countries were actually participating in the quarantine around Cuba. A lot of countries offered their air bases and their naval bases. Some countries, like Argentina and Venezuela even sent destroyers to participate in the quarantine. And the Soviets knew that a lot of countries were participating and were uniting against Cuba."

The editors of one version of the Kennedy tapes, Philip Zelikow and Ernest may are among a group of historians who have seen the Cuban missile crisis as a great triumph for Kennedy, not because of the danger that came with it, but because of the way they believe he managed, managed the communications with the Soviet Union, managed communications with the American public, and negotiated out of this crisis that could have gone to nuclear war.

I do see it as not as much of a clear victory, if when you look at the results for Latin America of the Cuban Missile Crisis, it brought a lot of death and destruction for decades to come. I mentioned Argentina earlier. That's an example of a country that, as a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis, became a lot closer to the United States, especially in terms of military relations. And there was one military leader in particular, Juan Carlos Ongania, who came to the attention of the United States during the missile crisis. He was the head of the Army, and he very enthusiastically supported the United States during the crisis, he organized a 3000 man unit that could be deployed in case of a land invasion. And then after the crisis, the United States was appreciative and especially trained him. Paid a lot of attention to ondania, but also the United States signed a military assistance approach, military assistance program with Argentina, and Argentina was the final country in the Americas to really become much more closely aligned militarily with the United States. And then, four years after the missile crisis, Juan Carlos Ongania staged a coup in Argentina, a military coup that would usher in more than a decade of other military coups that brought a death 10s of 1000s of people, mostly civilians, were killed or disappeared during Argentina's dirty war. And you can trace some of the roots of that back to the Cuban Missile Crisis. And so, yes, I would say the idea that this was a victory or or a near escape is not true when you look beyond the United States."

At the same time, you make a very powerful argument that the crisis contributed to the negotiation of the first nuclear free zone treaty, the Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1967 which most people don't know about, but created a nuclear weapons free zone, which remains the case to this day. In that region. I'd love to hear you reflect on what brought us from the Cuban Missile Crisis to this moment of horror to this moment of nuclear disarmament."

And so this experience of really being at the center of nuclear conflict revealed to a lot of Latin Americans their vulnerability. Their countries were unlikely to get nuclear weapons, except for places like Argentina and Brazil. And so a lot of countries within Latin America said, We don't want another missile crisis this. This was too close. And so Brazil and a number of other countries have been pushing before the missile crisis, for a nuclear free zone or some kind of agreement. And then Brazil came out of the crisis in not with a great relationship with the United States, to put it, to put it mildly. And so Mexico actually stepped into the breach and picked up where the Brazilians had left off. And the Mexicans did come out of the crisis with a very strong hemispheric position and relations with the United States. And so they started pushing for a nuclear weapons free zone, and it took about five years, but they were able to get another country, enough other countries, to sign on to establish the Treaty of tuataloco in 1967 like you mentioned, and that made Latin America the first nuclear weapons free zone in the world, and that set a precedent for other regions of the world to set up regional nuclear weapons free zones. And I think it was that experience of coming so close to nuclear war during the missile crisis, and this feeling of powerlessness that made a lot of people in Latin America willing to change their position and take action."

              "text": "And I guess that, to me, is is a bridge to where we are today. It does seem that in the decades after the Cuban Missile Crisis, there are a number of efforts that are made not only to limit nuclear weapons in the region, but also to limit American and Soviet and other, I guess, Chinese military activity in the region, and although the United States is involved in many covert activities supporting groups like the Contras and Nicaragua invading Grenada, nonetheless, you could argue that we at least avoid another big crisis like The Cuban missile crisis. But then I look at Venezuela today, and I wonder, if you, as a historian, see certain parallels to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Obviously, there's no Soviet presence in the region, but, but there is, of course, a Russian and a Chinese presence. And you know, it does seem, as the United States is has mobilized the largest force in its Southern Command, present and at sea around Venezuela, and is using force to destroy boats rather than interdict boats on the high seas. How do you think about this moment in relation to what you've just written about."

              "text": "I think there's a lot of parallels between our current moment and the Cuban Missile Crisis. One that jumps out to me is it's kind of the danger of saber rattling, right when we look at the causes of the Cuban Missile Crisis, I think that one of the main reasons that Khrushchev offered nuclear weapons to Castro in the first place was this clear sense that Cuba was under attack. You have the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961 you have Cuba being kicked out of the Organization of American States. You have operation mongoose, in which the United States is organizing all these covert activities against Cuba. And that sends a very clear message that the United States and the rest of the countries of Latin America do not intend to put up with Castro's government, and they want to undermine it and get Castro out of Cuba. And so I think we can see parallels today in Venezuela, where we are taking all these steps to undermine maduro's government. I think, just like Castro, he is, he is incredibly unpopular in the Inter American community. And you know, we're building up this sense of threat. And what I wonder is this, how is Maduro going to react? How are countries like Russia and China is how are they going to react? And could this escalate into, I'm guessing, probably not, another nuclear conflict, but it could be a very drawn out war if the United States decides to actually. We militarily intervene in Venezuela, and the fact that we still live in a nuclear era means that any major conflict, even if it doesn't appear to be a nuclear one on on the face or at first, could potentially escalate into one."

There was a lot of this sense of, we need to stand united as a country. We need to support Kennedy's position, support the quarantine. There wasn't a lot of criticism in the media. There wasn't, you don't see the same kind of huge protests that I mentioned in Latin America. But I think in Latin America, it's a completely different story. And people did feel empowered, and they did feel like they were participating in the crisis. And so you see not only these big protests, but you see people debating in the media. You see people in the other wings of the government, in senates, kind of debating their country's positions, and I think that that really mattered. It didn't necessarily help decide the question of whether there would be missiles in Cuba or not, but it did help influence their own country's political future, and I think that is an important message that that we can participate, and we can take steps in our own lives to shape what's going on in our own countries, and then that that connects to the rest of the world. I think another important lesson is that we're not isolated, you know, even even places that are islands are connected very closely to the rest of the world and the rest of the region, and so we can use those connections to our advantage."

I think there's a long history of the United States overestimating, overestimating its abilities to to determine other countries, political regimes, to target specific leaders. You know, in the case of Kasher, they tried so many ways to get him out of power, up to an including assassination and and invasion, and none of it works. And Cuba is a much smaller place than Venezuela, and so I would say there have been very few instances of success in that regard in Latin America. And then there's a question of, what happens next. So even if you do manage to remove a specific leader or change a specific government, like in the case of Chile, what happens next is, is the result or the conclusion any better? I would say, in most cases, know that the consequences have been extremely harmful for Latin Americans and for Inter American relations."

I think that's one of the overlooked lessons from the Cuban Missile Crisis, was that by working with regional allies, Kennedy was able to find to set the world on a path toward a peaceful resolution of the Cuban missile crisis by taking multilateral action instead of unilateral action. And so that would be my first recommendation was to would be to work with regional partners like. I said Maduro is extremely unpopular within the region, but by taking unilateral action, we are turning potential allies like Colombia against us, instead of working with them against Maduro,"

I love everything about your book, but I love in particular the way in which you do take us to the story of the Treaty of Tlatelolco and the efforts to to build peace in the region after this horrible, horrible crisis and the the nearness of extinction. I really think there's, there's a there's a lesson in that.
