And through limiting the participants, it actually, uh, made it easier to form consensus. And at some level that. Putting together, uh, keeping a consensus together seems crucial for you. Why? Why is that? So, why, why, why wouldn’t the opposite argument, the one that I think I’ve often made be true, which is the way I think of Madison’s argument on pluralism, that being large and being unbound. It means that, as we did throughout the 19th century, you know, you can add two new territories, one for one side, one Democratic, one Democratic territory, one wig or Republican territory. Um, why isn’t that, why isn’t the unbounding, uh, actually an advantage?"

So I don’t think that he thought it was limitless.

Uh, and then later in the 20th century you get Sheldon Wolin, who tells us that democracy is in, is inherently transgressive. It’s inherently challenging the constraints, uh, and structures that. Define what a constitution is, which is a system of constraints, a structure of constraints, that democracy is constantly challenging. Those constraints and that constitutions are inherently regimes that, uh, a particular set of, uh, democratic participants agrees, will secure their interests, then that democracy, uh, in a kind of dialectical fashion develops, outgrows those arrangements and needs to challenge them and constrain them. So you get this constant that that is the tension in this compound constitutional democracy. Uh, how can you get the security and protection that constitutions promise, uh, in democracies which are inherently transgressive and constantly challenging the constraints."

And what we’ve done on the mobilization side is to, along with the rights revolution, create these personal parties where the president controls his own political machinery. And on the management side, we’ve created this unitary theory of the executive, which gives the president a claim to exclusive and complete control over the power of the administrative branch of the executive branch. And that is not a formula for rewiring. That’s a formula for imposition, that’s a formula for, uh, volatility and divisiveness."

They sought to make the selection of the president indirect and blind to give him the executive power was to try to, was coupled with keeping him away from party interest in faction because they saw that a politicized president in control of the executive branch. Would undercut all the delicate balances that they had, uh, written into the rest of the constitutional frame. So I would say at least those three, those are the three that come to mind. Juristocracy, presidentialism, constitutional hardball. These are things that are showing us that it’s not working, it’s not work, it’s not by what, what do I mean by working? It’s not accommodating interests. It’s not stabilizing the system, the things that we assume that the con, that constitutions are meant to do."

Well, I would say that in writing this book, I became more sympathetic to Jefferson’s solution that is, you know, rethink the whole thing, every generation or so. But also in rewriting the book, I came to appreciate that we’ve really dug ourselves pretty deeply into this hole. That in order to have a constitutional convention, think about the original constitutional convention where, you know, uh, contentious interests. I mean, uh, uh, diametrically opposed interests came together around some sense of a common purpose that is the North and the South were able to subordinate their differences to exclude certain questions to, uh. To, uh, uh, to, uh, participate in this kind of deeply impacted institutional system, uh, because they had in mind the promise of a great commercial republic. They could agree on that. We want this. Great, we see the potential for what this could be."

Uh, what an alternative governing framework might look like. And you know, those are long-term propositions. I’m not sure we have a lot of time, but those are long-term propositions. I would give them a shot. You know, I thi I, things like experiments with deliberative democracy. I think that those. Our deliberative forums or, you know, those kinds of things I think are, are, are constructive. You know, I’m in favor of, um, this, uh, revival of interest in civics and civic education, although, uh, I think also symptomatic of the time is that no one can really agree on what the curriculum is. Um, yeah, so I’m, uh, uh. What should we do?
