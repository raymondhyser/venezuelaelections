Absolutely. We're gonna talk about all of that.  I wanted to open today, by just reading, the key section from President James Monroe’s, annual address to congress. In December of 1823. So more than 200 or more than a hundred years ago. Actually, no, 200 years. More than 200 years ago. I’m gonna have to work on my math here.\n\nthis is the key passage, written in fact by Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams. That becomes known as the Monroe Doctrine. It wasn’t known as the Monroe Doctrine initially, but it became over time known as the Monroe Doctrine. And what Monroe said was that we, the United States, owe it to candor and to the amiable relations existing between the United States.\n\nAnd those European powers, he means the European powers, operating empires in, Latin America. We owe it to declare that we, the United States, should consider any attempt on their parts to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety with the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power.\n\nWe have not interfered and shall not interfere, but with the governments who have declared their independence and maintained it and whose independence we have on great consideration and unjust principles acknowledged we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them or controlling in any other manner their destiny by any European power.\n\nIn any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States. What it seems to me, president Monroe was saying in this somewhat flowery language, was that the United States, would do all it could. To, make it difficult to not recognize, to hinder European powers from returning to colonies that they had lost in countries like Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela in this period of revolution and independence in the early 19th century.\n\nbut it seems to me Monroe is not saying. United States, will necessarily intervene militarily. Kurt, how do you, as a scholar of this region, think about what the Monroe Doctrine meant for the next 200 years, bringing us to today? I, I know it’s a big question, but I’m curious your reaction to it."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Conflict, Power and International Relations","tag":"Structural Drivers of Conflict"},{"category":"Conflict, Power and International Relations","tag":"Diplomacy and Peacebuilding"}],"uuid":"8feed255-2b46-4293-bf38-1ea4a2e927cb"},{"start_time":328,"end_time":444,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Kurt: So you see, you see various elements in that statement.

And you know, as you say, I mean, the Spanish and Portuguese would’ve liked to. Repose colonialism and the French and Brits might also have wanted to get into the game.\n\nAnd so the way it reads in some sense is, you know, quite idealistic. We wanna protect the liberty of those countries. And what you see, of course in the subsequent 200 years, a lot of shift be, I mean, in some sense, more with the increase in American power, especially after the Spanish American War, and then the Roosevelt corollary to the Monroe Doctrine where the unit is.\n\nStates appointed itself as the policeman of the Western hemisphere.

And this is the, you know, so-called backyard of the United States. So get out in that realist kind of spirit. You, you see President Trump then afterwards highlighting oil, oil, oil, kind of from an economic materialist.\n\nWe need our fingers unimportant. Element in. Maduro was an awful, repressive, corrupt dictator who had blatantly stolen an election in mid 2024.

From President Trump’s perspective, I still don’t completely understand why he would’ve done it.\n\nHe has that, that urge to assert American predominance. But I wonder to what extent this was also driven by the agenda of Marco Rubio and Marco Rubio, of course, has been at the forefront at combating the left axis of evil in Latin America.

And so I wonder to what extent this was not only Trump asserting predominance in terms of motivation, but also Rubio pushing that regime change agenda partly in light of the upcoming presidential succession in 2028 where he might wanna put his chips into the game.\n\nAnd so I think.

I think the case that is most similar in Early American intervention in Latin America is the case of Manuel Noriega in Panama in 1989, when you also had a ruthless, brutal, corrupt dictator who defied the United States. The United States in that sense did a less surgical strike by actually invading Panama at good cost of civilian lives and taking over the whole country, and then actually instituting democracy afterwards. So the target in Panama in 89 was quite similar. Some, I mean, just awful dictator who clearly deserve to be, put on trial. The Venezuelan case is different because it’s obviously not a full scale invasion, but that very, very surgical strike. but so there is a president in terms of the target, and you see in the avoidance of a full scale invasion, president Trump’s concern about getting dragged into. Regime change, potential trouble and turmoil, domestic conflict that could drag the United States into what the Trumpians would call nation building, Allah, Afghanistan, and Iraq. And so there is, there is a similarity in the target, but there’s also a different approach in doing this in a much more targeted way, which of course has, if you wish the disadvantage that you’ve.\n\nYou decapitated, autocratic, corrupt, repressive regime, but most of the power structure of the regime is still in place."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Conflict, Power and International Relations","tag":"Structural Drivers of Conflict"},{"category":"Governance, Law and Political Structures","tag":"Authoritarianism"},{"category":"Conflict, Power and International Relations","tag":"Warfare and Society"}],"uuid":"feb1cc9d-b9ff-4fe8-b5b1-d88a1262ab0d"},{"start_time":812,"end_time":857,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Jeremi: That’s what’s striking to me, Kurt, that this has been certainly a change in the.

It’s that the infrastructure to extract the oil is so decrepit that, that, that’s also kind of shut, shut itself down.

In some sense has an interest in maintaining stability, and the established regime is a firmly entrenched that they have a higher chance of maintaining stability than if you had a democratic transition with all the potential trouble in turmoil. So in terms of the domestic power structure, Venezuela very, very little has changed, but I think what will change is the foreign policy orientation of Venezuela.\n\nYou know, essentially. If the United States takes over oil, then it won’t go to China anymore, and clearly the United States will push for Venezuela to sever its links with Russia, with Iran, and Hezbollah, all these kinds of things. And the United States will. In the kind of semi colonial way, look over the shoulder of Del Rodriguez and make sure that in foreign policy she aligns with the US and not with countries that are enemies of the us.\n\nAnd I think one of the most important reorientations of Venezuelan foreign policy would be, and that speaks again to my point about the, cutting off Cuba from\n\noil and putting, putting an even bigger strangle on. If not suffocate that regime, just push them to the wall and force them to come to an accommodation with the United States. And so I think there will be a significant shift in Venezuela’s international alignments in foreign policy, and from Trump’s perspective, from Trump’s perspective, who doesn’t care about democracy?

They’re trying to bribe and threaten their own, allies and the Chinese have, have a major presence on the ground. I isn’t. The effort to do what you just said from a distance from the United States, as you say, acting as a kind of distant colonial overseer isn’t that likely to lead to factionalization internal fighting in Venezuela and and something that becomes quite disorderly that the United States either has to get involved in directly or ignore."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Governance, Law and Political Structures","tag":"Authoritarianism"},{"category":"Origins, Development and Historical Change","tag":"Democratic Risks and Threats"}],"uuid":"c1671191-a022-45fa-8e0f-aaef7960b9d9"},{"start_time":1043,"end_time":1264,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Kurt: There is certainly a possibility, and there is one reason why I’m surprised that then Donald Trump did this because there is clearly, there is a risk that Venezuela could dissent into internal strife and conflict and that somehow other, that could draw in the United States. And that’s of course what Donald Trump wants to avoid at all costs.\n\nSo this, this is a possibility, but. I think when you think from the great powers that Trump wants to push out of Venezuela, but I think it’s much more likely not that the Chinese and the Russians, not to speak of Iran, are going to take a stand in or about Venezuela, but that this is the essentially. They will find compensation in their spheres of, in, in interest. And so what you see is that the whole Trumpian approach to international relations is kind of stone age realism. Great powers have their spheres of influence and they can do inside their sphere of influence as they wish. And so I think the.\n\nThe kind of the, how should I say that? What China and Russia will get out of that is Trump’s acquiescence in them taking more control of their spheres of influence. You know, and I think you see that with Trump’s accommodation of Russia in the Ukraine war. I don’t know what it would exactly mean for China and the South China Sea in vis-a-vis Taiwan, but I think, I think kind of the game among the great powers will be less. That they will, that China and Russia will fight tooth and nail to maintain a stake in the US’ backyard, the western hemisphere, but that they will say, whoa, you did this in your own sphere of influence. Now we have a freer hand in our sphere of influence. I think that’s how that will work. And as regards to domestic power structure in Venezuela, I. I would assume that Trump knows about his own severe a tension deficit disorder, that he couldn’t pay attention to Venezuela very much. But I think he’s probably going to appoint kind of an informal Vice Roy in, in, in Ambassador in Vene in Venezuela. I bet the American Embassy in Venezuela is going to swell to hundreds of people who will keep an eye on things and the the factions. That are more radical and that are more they know, you know, have much clo, much more control of the organs of coercion in Venezuela, the defense minister, Patino and Di Caveo, who controls these thugs and goons and militias, the so-called collectives, I think they will know. That if they mess around too much and they cause too much trouble, they might get yanked out and put in the prison cell next to my daughter.\n\nAnd\n\nso I think they will have to swallow a lot of, what you call in Latin America, swallow a lot of toads and hang low for a while. They will of course, hope that the Trump administration will move on. You know, I, I think in many ways what, what the Venezuelan power structure is doing is what the Wolf did in the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hole.\n\nThey’re eating a lot of chalk and like, Hey, you know, we can play game. And of course, they’re hoping that Trump moves on, that the United States can’t actually control what’s going on and it sooner or later they can reassert their control. They can, you know, they can. Get their fingers again into the contraband, into the corruption, maybe not the drug trafficking as they did before.\n\nI think that’s the game that is being played, and in some strange way, it serves Trump and it serves that Venezuelan power structure.

It’s very fluid, it’s uncertain what will happen. It is uncertain what will happen in Venezuela. It’s uncertain what will happen in the international system because Donald Trump is so highly unpredictable to typical populism. So, so. You know, in, in the Venezuelan case, which will also affect American foreign policy. I think one of the biggest points of uncertainty is that by. Constitution that Ugo Chavez himself pushed through in 1999 by the Constitution. If the presidency is vacant and you have a transition to somebody else, there should be the convocation of new elections. That would of course provide a very important opening for the Democratic transition that Trump has shockingly marginalized and kind of pushed aside to get into the game and that, you know, if there were a real election, real competitive. that could cause a good amount of uncertainty, trouble turmoil, especially if the Democratic opposition had a chance of winning and or no, of of course, especially if it won.\n\nAnd so how that will play out. I mean, the established power structure in Venezuela currently headed by Delcy Rodriguez has no interest in no elections. In some sense, Donald Trump has no interest and they might well maneuver. Collude in trying to avoid this. But you know, as you mentioned a couple of minutes ago, the Venezuelan people are yearning for a new start.\n\nThe opposition will do everything they can to push for elections. De Marco Ruby or agenda in the US might wanna have a regime change in Venezuela. And so how that will play out, I think is one of the main sources of uncertainty because. Contested competitive election and if the opposition were to win and there’s trouble and term on the Venezuela and protests and counter protests and violence, that could really draw the United States into the domestic politics and, you know, greatly change the equation and turn the Venezuelan case maybe more similar to the story in Afghanistan and\n\nIraq.\n\nAnd so it’s very unpredictable."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Social and Economic Forces","tag":"Universities"}],"uuid":"b992a099-9584-4213-9744-12ce2db7020d"},{"start_time":1766,"end_time":1766,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Jeremi: right,"}]}],"tags":[],"uuid":"c4f5bcf3-b3d4-4932-a2d5-f159c8d8dcaf"},{"start_time":1766,"end_time":1777,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Kurt: Unfortunately, political science, political science hasn’t, you know, come up with a general loss that we could confidently make any clear assertions about a case like Venezuela."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Social and Economic Forces","tag":"Universities"}],"uuid":"53c25160-5669-4fa9-aa3a-048d5d7e149c"},{"start_time":1777,"end_time":1817,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Jeremi: Right, right.
