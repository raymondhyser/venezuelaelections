Today we are going to talk about civics and history, education, a topic near and dear to this podcast each week, and a topic near and dear to many people in our society today. What does it mean? To have a serious civics and historical education. Why is this important and, most interesting? Maybe why is this such a contentious issue in our society today? We are going to talk to, someone who I think has thought more about these issues than almost anyone else. I know he’s a leading scholar and pedagogical in innovator. this is Professor Steven Mintz, my colleague at the University of Texas at. Austin, Steve, welcome to our podcast."

He is, as I said before, not only, a prolific author, but a pedagogical innovator. He was for five years. The director of the UT Systems Institute for Transformational Learning, where he did a lot of pioneering work, in online and other forms of technological education. Steve has written many prize-winning books. I’m just going to name two that I highly recommend. There are two that I certainly have learned a lot from. one is called Hux Raft. Which, by the way, has a really beautiful cover among other things. it’s a history of American childhood published, around 2004, I believe. And then his, most recent book, I believe is the Learning Centered University, making College a more developmental, transformational and Equitable Experience. a book that certainly taught me a lot about not only the, history of the university, but about, many of the challenges and opportunities that we have today. So we are very fortunate to have Steve with us, before we get into our discuss. With Steve. as always, we have an opening poem, and today it’s a poem that Zachary, you have written yourself, coming back to Your Roots as our podcast poet. Yes, Zachary?"

People aren’t just arguing about civics or about history. They’re really arguing about values, patriotism, and democracy itself. And what makes this particularly difficult is there’s two opposing visions. Of civics one, which I favor, is to, instill a deep understanding of foundational facts, content, to learn that American history has been a constant debate, struggle, conflict over fundamental values and purpose and direction. And then there is another form of civics education, which is much more applied, that looks at contemporary events. And these are so divisive. I think that’s not the way we should really go. I think, a backward glance will be more helpful in this fraught context. Then focusing on issues that often students don’t have any deep knowledge about. Anyway,"

And one thing that makes me a bit sad about our own department, UT Austin, one of the largest history departments in the United States. Is we don’t really teach enough political history because politics isn’t simply about checks and balances. It is ultimately where we as a democratic society debate the serious issues before us and reach collective conclusions and. A history department that doesn’t really focus on politics is missing a huge opportunity. And again, I wanna stress, I am a social historian. I’ve written about slavery, I’ve written about social movements for reform. I’ve written about private life. But if we don’t teach. The history of politics. We are not doing our students a service."

This was an issue in 17 87, 17 91, 18 65, and continues on to today. We need students to engage in those debates, but not as opinion, not as theorizing, but grounded in the actual debates that took place. And those debates do not just involve major political figures, cast in marble or bronze. They involve ordinary Americans who took part in those debates, who contested issues in the courts, who fought for their rights collectively. That’s the story I think about how America really works. Now we often focus on powerful individuals, and I’m not opposed to that, but in a democracy, most power is expressed Collectively, we are members of groups that advocate for our interests and that can teach our students an awful lot about how power works in a democracy."

How can that be? And part of the answer is that in our emphasis on mathematical literacy. And language arts. We’ve downplayed civics and social studies. We need to devote more time to this.

Further under state law, the working groups that develop the techs as they’re known, the Texas Essentials knowledge and Skills, these are to be created by experienced educators. That is by teachers. By curriculum designers, by professors who have actual expertise teaching these subjects.

What happened at the Battle of Bull Run. It’s something in between that, and it is measurable, and the job of the Board of Education is to spell out those essential learning objectives and not to dictate a curriculum. And certainly not to tell people how to learn. And further, the state says through law that the standards are to prepare students for college. 70% of high school students will go on to college in Texas. They need to be prepared for our classes, and that requires them to have certain foundational knowledge. And I want to ensure that. and so if you design a curriculum that downplays world history and world cultures, we are not preparing our students for the kind of education that they will receive, either a community college at a regional comprehensive university at a private university, or a flagship university. We need to do better and the way to do better is simply to follow the law."

Instead, what we’re teaching about is the role of religious groups, of religious ideas in shaping this nation. we can debate on specific cases. who was right, who was wrong, what were the limits? What should be the limits? But religion needs to occupy a place in the curriculum. But that is an academic place, not a doctrinal place. one thing that makes the United States unique among advanced developed countries is we have a much higher level of religious belief. That is an element in American exceptionalism, but it’s also an academic question. Why is it that the United States is a much more religious churchgoing society than any of the countries in Western Europe? this is a subject that we can discuss academically and should, I do believe that earlier versions of US history that downplayed religion were mistakes. Religion is a key element in shaping this society’s values. It has been the driving force behind almost every reform movement in America, whether we’re talking about the civil rights movement or the labor movement, or the social gospel that inspired progressivism. Religion has a place in the curriculum, but it is not. We are not to teach religion as dogma or doctrine."

The first outspoken, what we would call feminist statements about the position of women in society. We shouldn't have a narrow conception of what debates count and what debates don't count. We should include all of the speakers who are part of these debates, which you'll discover. It's no challenge to include diversity in this kind of discussion.

Imagine being able to bring in infinite number of primary sources into every classroom in this society. And not just written texts, but music, film, clips, artworks, and the like. We can do that, and we can do that because of technology. You know what a wonderful opportunity. Also, we can create environments where students can make presentations using technological tools. They can create mini movies, they can create infographics and the like. This is not hard to do anymore. This is easy to do. So let’s do it. Let me just give. A couple of examples from my own class, things that I have students do. I give every student in my class a small cemetery on Cape Cod, and in that cemetery, they look at every gravestone. There’s usually only about 20 gravestones still existing in those cemeteries. And they look at the names, they look at the. Birth dates and the date of death, and then they have to draw conclusions. They look at the iconography on the top of the gravestone and they describe it. I can do that because of technology. And what an opportunity for the students they discover. To their surprise, children die more than anyone else. They discover. That if you lived over the age of 20, you lived not quite as long as we do today, but as long as our parents lived right, they lived into their seventies and eighties, they discovered that women died earlier than men. Unlike today when men died later than women, there is a lot to discuss in class and another. Technological tool I give my students is a sort of version, a flight simulator. You are Columbus and you have to sail from the new world, I mean from the old world to the new world and back using current wind and ocean currents and you discover it is not easy to do. You have to sail south along the coast of Africa from Spain, then cross over. You’re approaching Brazil, and then you sell northward before you can reach the Caribbean. It is not easy, and to get back, you have to sell northward towards Canada. Cross over towards Ireland and Britain before you can sail south. To Spain. People appreciate Columbus’ navigation skills when they do this, that this is not easy. Now there’s other conversations they can have about Columbus, but this one I think they find interesting and it’s hands-on learning using technology tools and that turns. History, education into active learning, not just passive listening."

I think one thing that I’ve certainly learned is that a lot of it doesn’t necessarily come down to the standards or the curricula, but it comes down to the teacher in the classroom. And I think part of the problem is that so much of the money and attention and accolades have gone. To those teaching stem, courses, math, economics, science, computer science, engineering, et cetera. And less attention has been paid to building, sustaining, and encouraging, really effective and passionate teachers of civics and history. And I think, so in the same way that, Good teachers at universities and colleges, make all the difference. I think in the same way it’s true at, in, at a high school level and middle school and elementary school."

Steve, what should non-teachers who care about and non-pro professors who care about these issues, what should they do? What should ordinary citizens be doing right now? if they care about history as we do, how can they get involved? How can they, help you in your efforts?"

It’s to teach students how to think historically and reason responsibly and learn how to live in a pluralistic democracy. We need great teachers who can do that. We need great curricula that seek to do that. We need forms of pedagogy that actually engage our students. So I think what the public needs to insist upon is not social studies as some kind of ideological endeavor, but rather education as it ought to be. Yes, education as inquiry, education as problem solving. Education is building on evidence and primary sources. That’s the education our students need."
