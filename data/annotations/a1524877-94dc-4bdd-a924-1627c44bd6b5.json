Uh, especially his unwillingness to tolerate nonsense from anyone, uh, and his sort of unflagging commitment to humanity. In, in world events. Uh, and this is a section that I think speaks to that, that maybe I hope also offers us some words of consolation, uh, and maybe also put some fire, uh, behind this as well.\n\nThis is, uh, of section again from Can socialists be happy? The inability of mankind to imagine happiness except in the form of relief, either from effort or pain, presents socialists with a serious problem. Dickens can describe a poverty stricken family tucking into a roast goose and can make them appear happy.\n\nOn the other hand, the inhabitants of perfect universes seem to have no spontaneous gaity and are usually somewhat repulsive into the bargain. But clearly we are not aiming at the kind of world Dickens described, nor probably at any world he was capable of imagining. The socialist objective is not a society where everything comes right in the end because kind old gentlemen give away turkeys.\n\nWhat are we aiming at, if not a society in which charity would be unnecessary? We want a world where Scrooge with his dividends and tiny Tim with his tuberculous leg would both be unthinkable. But does that mean we are aiming at some painless, effortless utopia? At the risk of saying something, which the editors of Tribune, sorry, Tribune was the paper it was published in May not endorse.\n\nI suggest that the real objective of socialism is not happiness. Happiness hither two has been a byproduct, and for all we know, it may always remain. So the real objective of socialism is human brotherhood. This is widely felt to be the case, though. What is not usually said or not said loudly enough.\n\nMens up their lives in heartbreaking political struggles or get themselves killed in civil wars, or tortured in the secret prisons of the Gestapo. Not in order to establish some central heated, air conditioned, strip lighted paradise, but because they want a world in which human beings love one another instead of swindling and murdering one another, and they want that world as a first step.\n\nWhere they go from there is not so certain, and the attempt to foresee it in detail merely confuses the issue. Nearly all creators of Utopia have resembled the man who has toothache, and therefore things happiness consists in not having toothache. They wanted to produce a perfect society by an endless continuation of something that had only been valuable because it was temporary.\n\nThe wider course would be to say that there are certain lines along which humanity must move. The grand strategy is mapped out, but detailed prophecy is not our business. Whoever tries to imagine perfection simply reveals his own emptiness."

It’s more complicated than though, I think what he’s saying is that what happiness is is something temporary and fleeting. Uh, a feeling of community or a feeling of, uh, contentment or joy that only exists, uh, in contrast to the drudgery of everyday life or the injustices of everyday life.\n\nUm, and I think that’s very relevant for, for all of us who have celebrated holidays in the new year, in the last few weeks. Um, I think that’s probably something a lot of us have felt, not just this year, but in past years as well. Um, and I think he’s als what he’s also saying is that, uh, there’s danger. In seeing or seeking or defining your political program based on some perfect or idealized version of how the world should be, because human beings have limited imagination and the only way we can really imagine a perfect world.\n\nIs as one that is simply a continuation of all of the creature comforts and a universalization of all of the creature comforts of our world. Um, and so I think oral is really urging is for us to respond to inhumanity with humanity and to see injustice. Not as something that must be, um, completely eliminated to see, uh, to see pain and suffering, not as something that can ever be completely eliminated, but instead to see those as things that must be responded to.\n\nNot necessarily with a positive universal vision of what, of what the future must be, and we must all work to, but actually with a human feeling of brotherhood, as he calls it, with a commitment to fighting for justice, but not any sort of sense or promise that justice is ever going to come immediately in the present or in the future."

And unfortunately, we were just talking about this before we, we started the recording. Uh, this was a year, maybe not with more inhumanity than other years, but certainly with a fair share of inhumanity.\n\nUm, and one, one can think about, uh, the murders, the cold-blooded murders, assassinations of, uh, a legislator and her, uh, husband in Minnesota. Followed a few months later by the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Uh, we can think also of the assassination that occurred of a insurance executive this year and, and many others.\n\nUh, just this was a murderous year where extremists of one kind or another used excessive on un uh, un unacceptable illegitimate violence, uh, against individuals. Uh, of course there was mass violence as well. Thousands and thousands of deaths in Ukraine and elsewhere. Um, we saw also the violence and inhumanity of deportations within our own country.\n\nPeople being seized off the street sometimes when they had gone to a, um, immigration hearing that they were invited to, seized from a court. Uh, when they had come voluntarily to, uh, appear, uh, believing that they were getting, um, legal access to our country, but instead being in a sense kidnapped and often.\n\nDeported to a country that he never had any connection to. Uh, El Salvador, Sudan, uh, things of that sort. So, so there was plenty of inhumanity, uh, and plenty of inhumanity with all kinds of political stripes attached to it, uh, in all kinds of places. So I think we know what Inhumanity is and we know what Orwell’s referring to there as himself being a child of the revolutions of the 1930s and, uh, wars of the 1940s.\n\nUm. What is humanity? What, when, when, when Orwell encourages us to respond to inhumanity with humanity, to not simply respond an eye for an eye, to not simply respond to the murder of our guy by murdering their guy. Uh, what, what does he, what do you think he means? Because I think that’s the hard part here, Zachary.\n\nWhat do you think he means?"

I, I think there were examples maybe to help us, uh, from this year describe what humanity in response to inhumanity is. There were examples we saw of this one that certainly moved me and I think moved you even more, Zachary. Was the experience of, uh, the hostages, uh, hostages in, um, Israel, uh, Israelis who had been taken hostage brutally by Hamas.\n\nUh, some of them held hostage for more than two years. Uh, and the release of those high hostages, uh, in many ways, uh. Their experiences once released. Um, I know you had the opportunity to talk to a few of these former hostages yourself, Zachary. My impression is that they, after being released from this nightmare-ish horror that I cannot even imagine, um, it’s not that they.\n\nWanted to forgive Hamas. They certainly didn’t. Uh, there’s nothing that says we have to forgive the people who do horrible things to us, but they also, it seems to me, became voices against more violence and voices for peace. Is is that right?"

Encouraging us to find the good guys and the bad guys and to recognize without apologizing for.\n\nUh, unacceptable behavior, illegal behavior, uh, immoral behavior, recognizing that in many cases, um, people are driven by complex experiences and motives. As you were speaking of the hostages, I was thinking of so many, uh, immigrants to the United States who have now been swept up by ice. Um, many of whom actually did break a law.\n\nMaybe they came on a student visa and overed. Maybe they came on a tourist visa at overstate, but then they’ve lived here for 10 years, 12 years. They’ve raised a family, they’ve worked diligently, and the reason they didn’t go back to their country, this could be true for our great grandparents, Zachary, the reason they didn’t go back was not because they wanted to break a law here, but because they were afraid to go back and face persecution or face abject poverty.\n\nUm, so are they people who broke a law? Maybe. But should they be deported for that as criminals? That’s, that’s a complex story, right? And we should avoid these simple, simple categories. Um, I think about that at universities too. As a, as a professor, as someone watching at my university, university of Texas and elsewhere, major changes in controversy swirling around everything we do.\n\nFrom discussions of diversity to curriculum, to hiring, to leadership, to funding, you know, um, one doesn’t have to believe that universities were perfect. They certainly weren’t. To also believe that there’s something that needs to be saved and preserved in academic freedom, an open inquiry. And, uh, we become oversimplified and polarized.\n\nAnd are you for DEI or against DEI? Well, I’m both. Are you, uh, for, um, people being free to think and speak as they wish, uh, or are you for protecting people from facing antisemitism? anti-ISIS, Islamophobia and things of that sort. Well, um, for both of those too, right? I mean, these are, these are complex issues we have to navigate.\n\nAnd I think 2025 has taught us, and I have a sense a lot of people coming out of 2025 realizing this, that the simple categories are not the realities, the complex realities, uh, we, we face. Uh, may, maybe one of the lessons from Orwell that you’re teaching, taking us to is not only to personalize, to understand the individuals who are affected by big ideas, but also.\n\nTo move beyond labels. Right. Uh, Orwell’s not only attacking the socialist party, he’s attacking the label."

As someone who’s also at a university campus, I think the hardest part about the way that universities are being talked about and the worst part about how they’re being talked about, uh, on, on both sides, uh, in international discourse, uh, is, is the sort of insistence on labels, as you’ve said, the insistence on, on making every academic question.\n\nOne of are is this DEI or is this anti DI is this is this anti Right. Instead of focusing on, uh, complexity. And I think, I think if there’s one hopeful. Hopeful thing that I think we can take out of this moment for universities is that, uh, I think for, I think a lot of the sort of. Urges to grasp for labels.\n\nThe urge for simplification is actually rooted in a genuine frustration with the lack of complexity, if that makes any sense. Yeah. I think we’re taking, people are taking, um, frustration at academic environments that don’t allow for complexity or don’t allow for certain perspectives to be heard and actually doing the exact same thing and turning them into oversimplified labels and, and, and talking about universities in oversimplified ways in response.\n\nBut I think the urge or the frustration that’s there. Is is very genuine."

They’re, they’re, they’re recreating, they’re mirroring the problem that they saw by doing the exact opposite. I think that’s definitely happened. Um, I don’t know if you agree.\n\nI think that we, and I said this before in our podcast and in many other settings, um, I think we went too far with certain elements of DEI. Demanding, you know, diversity statements from people in a kind of McCarthyite way, loyalty oaths to diversity. And I think we went too far. Um, but I think now the response to having gone too far is going much too far in the other direction, to the point where now diversity has become a dirty word for some people.\n\nAnd you’re not supposed to, uh, assign. Work that points to perhaps the critical and not savory parts of our history, um, that that’s overreacting in the other direction. That’s mirroring, that’s a toothache for a toothache. Uh, if you’re against, um, preference for one direction, there shouldn’t be preference in the other direction either.\n\nAnd, and I think, I think one of the lessons we have to learn is that if we’re not attentive to complexity, all we do is just, uh, swing the, the spectrum back and forth. It’s like a seesaw. Rather than progress. So, so that brings us to, I think, the theme we wanted to close on, which is community. Um, I, I think one of the real, um, outcomes of 2025 is I’ve seen this with my students, with my colleagues around the country.\n\nI’ve seen this with all kinds of settings I’ve been in. People seem to be returning to community. They seem to have found in many cases that the world and the lives they were living. Online and elsewhere, we’re not satisfied. Clearly people are still living in those ways. Uh, but there is, there does seem to be a return to community and, um, I don’t know.\n\nIt might be worth talking about that. I think that’s been an important part of your experience also. Right, Zachary?"

That I think part of the problem is that a lot of attacks on universities and in the last. 10 years, both from both sides. Um, were really aimed at replacing a problem that they saw that had some truth to it.\n\nTrying to just simply eliminate the problem. Whereas the real solution and the really important thing that I think is, is, is missing or needs to be strengthened on college campuses and in all aspects of our society, um, is something positive. It’s the kind of bonds of community, the bonds between people, the willingness to have open and frank conversations about hard topics.\n\nThat’s what we should be focusing on. It’s not, it’s not about, you know, it’s not about trying to replace the toothache with the absence of a toothache, just end the toothache. It’s about trying to actually provide some sort of positive program in the opposite direction. It’s not.

It becomes artificial in that sense. Yes. It’s creating a culture for that. Yes. It’s, it’s honestly what I strive to do in the classroom, in my professional settings, in my work.\n\nUh, I don’t know if I succeed, but it’s certainly what I strive to do, what I’m doubling down on, which is, um. Cultivating a sense, a healthy skepticism toward any orthodoxy, which hopefully open space then for nothing to be sacred, but everything to be respected if it’s serious. So a serious idea should not be condescended to, but it shouldn’t be taken as an orthodoxy.\n\nThat is beyond question, and that allows us then to take. Complex ideas such as, you know, the defense of the state of Israel or the defense of the stateless, uh, in areas that are occupied by Israel. Take these difficult problems and recognize that neither side has a monopoly of truth. And open the space where it is encouraged for people to ask hard questions.\n\nIt doesn’t happen in one conversation. It happens in a culture that you create in a classroom, in a work setting. In your scholarship, in your public persona. And, and I think 2025 showed us, first of all, how hard it is to do that. It showed us how hard we need to work on that. And, and I think it did give us some examples, uh, of this.\n\nUm, I, I think we saw from certain religious leaders an incredible openness, uh, and cultivation of that kind of culture. Uh, this, this year, I think of the bishops and others who spoke out. In defense of immigrants, but didn’t speak out in defense of open borders. They weren’t talking about opening borders, they were talking about the humanity of immigrants.\n\nUm, I think of all the teachers I’ve witnessed, I work with a lot of teachers around the country, um, who have, who have done this in their classrooms. They’re unsung heroes. They don’t get, this doesn’t get talked about. I’ve seen this also with law enforcement officers build trust in their local communities.\n\nYou know, this is happening every day. We just don’t focus on it because we don’t value it enough, but it’s actually the story that we, we, we should focus on. I think it’s what is happening. In many parts of our universities, it’s not always happening and sometimes it’s missing, uh, but it is happening in many parts of our universities."

Uh, my frustration has been that many people who know this don’t take the time to do this. All of us as leaders. All of us as individuals and communities should do more to reach out to talk to other people, not just for one conversation where we want to hear multiple points of view, but to build a culture of conversation across points of view.\n\nAnd we should resist what I think is happening in too many places, including sometimes at universities where people are separated, one group versus another. Categorize in one way. Will you go in one major will be people thinking this way in another school, people thinking this way. No, we need to actually.\n\nBuild true bridges and talk across communities and make that part of our daily culture, the way we, the way we operate. And I think we can do that.
