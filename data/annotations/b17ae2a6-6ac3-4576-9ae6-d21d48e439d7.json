That is, of course, the weeks long standoff between anti-ice protests in Minneapolis and the various immigration enforcement wings of the Department of Homeland Security standoff.\n\nThat unfortunately, as we all know, has left at least two protestors, Renee Goode and Alex pretty dead. joining us is Professor David Iona Chang. Professor Chang is a historian at the University of Minnesota. He studies indigenous people, colonialism, borders, and migration in Hawaii and North America, focusing especially on the histories of Native American and Native Hawaiian people, as well as the history of social movements in the United States.\n\nProfessor Chang, thank you so much for joining us."

Jeremi, thank you for joining us today. for the first time in a while. we will start not with a speech or an essay, but with an original poem that I wrote. this is called, Nicolette Avenue, which is the street where Alex Pretty was killed.\n\nAt night when the street is sleeping, it tosses and turns ice cracking sounds of agony, softly rising from the salt. I think the street has nightmares, and I think it remembers the dead, the bullets that bounced off its skin and buried themselves in another. At night when the street is sleeping, it feels the boots that stomped across to the tune of swinging rifles, beating time on its surface like a song.\n\nI think the street is singing in its sleep. A Durge for the Dead and departed for the Cold Press of cold flesh. It remembers too well waking up last Sunday with Bloodstains. Yeah. So Professor Chang, would you be able to tell us just from your experience, you know, what it’s been like to live, in the Twin Cities at this moment?\n\nTo live through, what all of us around the country and around the world are seeing on the news every day."

It has been, everybody’s experiences in the cities is going to be different, and I'm speaking to you of course, as you know, a person with a lot of privilege. I’m a university professor. I have a lot of. I have a lot of privileges that softened my life, if you will. At the same time, it’s a very, intense period in the Twin Cities.\n\nIt’s been a time though where I would emphasize it’s been both a time of terror and sadness, but also a time of inspiration. And hope, ter and sadness are obvious to anyone around the globe, of course, because they see that federal forces, who are heavily armed and undertrained and very much under, Under supervised, if you will. and there’s very, and under-regulated are terrorizing our neighbors and our communities arresting people, taking them into custody, abducting them, Around the clock, and we’re talking about hundreds and hundreds of people, the numbers that ICE is giving out can’t really be trusted ’cause they’re not really backed up with a lot of numbers.\n\nBut clearly many people are being abducted. Many people have been physically hurt, many people have been traumatized, and their families as well. At the same time, I do think the national and global media has started to pick up on what is one of the most important parts of this story. And that’s the solidarity of the response.\n\nThat’s the, the loving kindness of the community, the bravery and the courage in responding in ways that are very dramatic for the cameras, such as standing between, Ice and someone that they’re trying to abduct and also much quieter driving kids to high school or dropping off groceries or necessary SAN supplies at people’s homes.\n\nso that response has, a. It is, profoundly inspiring. It gives me great hope, not only for this movement, but also for other, for the political work, which is also of course the human work of society and community that we’ll have to do in the coming years."

              "text": "I think that, I’d like to look to multiple routes. Like most things, they come from multiple. Most things that are strong, come from multiple roots. one of that is the very strong and specific social roots of the of, Minnesota. as well as the Twin Cities itself. There is a strong history.\n\nCivic nationalist, civic national engagement here with the notion that the United States is a nation of people committed to certain ideals. Those ideals are enshrined in certain documents, and those documents ensure certain rights and set up certain processes that must be followed. there is a strong commitment to this idea here, and, despite its limitations, view this kind of liberal nationalism right now, we’re seeing, what it can do in certain moments when institutions, processes, and the idea of EQ of equality under the law.\n\nBecomes threatened. That’s combined with a culture that has both religious and secular roots, that you know, everything from Lutheranism to Trotskyism that has been very strong in, Minnesota, the Northern Plains, and Minneapolis St. Paul for a very long time. And we can see this. In the strong religious, and church-based movements, that helped to create the welcoming environment that sponsored refugees from around the world after the American Secret War in Southeast Asia that welcomed people from East Africa, that west welcomed people from Korea after the Korean War, et cetera.\n\nThis created a population that was, you know, diverse in a very specific way. and, and very globalized in a very specific way that combined with kind of the labor part of the farmer labor of the DFL, the democratic farmer labor, party, which is the form of the Democratic Party that we have here in the state, which has really strong, very labor left, kind of orientations, and that’s been important here.\n\nAnd then, so all of that’s local, right? and that’s been, it’s been nurtured here. And of course the, we’re coming here, you know, five years after the killing and the uprising following the murder of, of George Floyd on Chicago Avenue. And that created an idea. Solidarity. Many different kinds of ideas, many different kinds of soar where people understood themselves as responsible for the community.\n\nOne of these ideas and practices, which is very strong here, is that of mutual aid. that we take care of us, that we stand up for us. and you see that in the everyday courage of people simply going around doing humble, simple things to support. Again, as well as the dramatic things that the cameras capture.\n\nAll of that comes together with a national environment. We’re not the first city doing this, right? So there was Chicago, there was Portland, there was Los Angeles, there’s others, and already in those different places. One can find communities come together in order to support. We learned from Chicago, Chicago learned from other cities, right?\n\nThe proliferation of neighborhood networks, of leaderless movements in order to, create a better, safer community that doesn’t come just from us. So and ho And I do not think it will stop just here either. Unfortunately, this is a national problem and it will continue in other cities, and I think that we can look forward to a historical moment that we can’t entirely anticipate, but it will be different because there is now a genealogy, a continuity of modes of resistance, which are drawing upon historical precedent elsewhere."

Your guess is as good as mine, what’s going to happen in the next two weeks? Right? because there’s a deliberate opacity here, right? I mean, think about the visuals of the mask, the refusals to explain oneself, the insulin. In the face of the judiciary, all of these are of a piece, right?\n\nIt’s a claiming of absolute authority.

Of Renee Goodnell is pretty right. okay, now they have video that says that Alex got into a scuffle with some agents and kicked at headlights or something like that.\n\nThat’s not a domestic terrorist, right? That’s not a domestic terrorist. So they got, they, they spoke too strong, too quick, and the data is too strong to, refute their narrative. on top of that, these are appealing young-ish. White people who are idealistic and good. So in other words, the media narrative on them is, cleaner.\n\nRight? So, I mean, it, these are not, racialized people, right? and so therefore they, the story plays in a certain way and I, want to take nothing away from them, right? I’m just saying that in terms of how media works. They, figure in a particular strength. And I think also it’s, it is, they are being seen as in some ways emblematic of the Minnesota movement, what’s going on in Minnesota and Minnesota.\n\nThe upper Midwest, as you know, it occupies a certain kind of.

We see this in this, in the, Civil Rights Movement, where you see the Voting Rights Act, right, for example, is very much about, we don’t trust local authorities.\n\nThat is state, county, and, and municipal governments to protect the rights of racialized people or to right, protect the rights of the powerless. Therefore, we look to Washington. It’s so much the opposite now, and as an American historian, doesn’t it make your head spin?"

Like some people I think are outraged, at, you know, the particular killings of Alex Pretty or Renee Good, or they, see. They see, those as the, thing to be out, outraged about. I think there are those who find who are most horrified or most focused on, the impact of the deportations on immigrant communities.\n\nso I think there are a range of political responses.

There is a big sort of walkout today for in solidarity with Minneapolis. so there, there, are a range of different responses that I think people are engaging in, but I would say, I think it’s, almost universal, universal shock at the shootings of, protesters in particular.\n\nGo."
