This week, we are continuing our discussion of democracies and elections around the world. This is, as we've said many times on the podcast, this is a year with more democracies voting, and more non democracies voting as well in elections around the world than at any point in human history before. And these elections and democracies and non democracies will really set the course for so many countries and probably for our globe moving forward for the next years and decades we are going to discuss today the recent elections in Venezuela and the controversies over those recent elections in Venezuela. On July 28 2024 the country of Venezuela held elections, and the incumbent president and dictator, NicolÃ¡s Maduro, claims he won the elections, but almost all observers, including the United States, are pretty clear on the evidence that Maduro lost these elections, what has happened in Venezuela and where do we go from here? We're going to understand the history surrounding these elections, what occurred in these elections, and we're going to think about based on knowledge of what's happened in other societies, particularly in the same region. We're going to discuss where we think these election results might go in the future of Venezuela. We are fortunate to be joined by my colleague and friend and someone who I think has done some of the most impressive work on authoritarianism and related regime change issues in Latin America. This is my colleague, Professor Kurt Wayland. Kurt Wayland is the Mike Hogg Professor in the Liberal Arts at the University of Texas at Austin. He's done amazing primary source research and direct interviews, the kind of work that historians love when you get dirty with the primary sources. He's done this research in so many countries in the region, probably as many as anyone else, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Peru and, of course, Venezuela. I probably left off some other countries, and I've of course forgotten to mention that he's also done research in the United States. Professor Wayland is the author of seven books. I'm going to just name a few of them, The Politics of Market Reform in Fragile Democracies, which was published in 2002, Making Waves: Democratic Contention in Europe and Latin America. 2014. Assault on Democracy: Communism, Fascism and Authoritarianism During the Interwar Years, published in 2021 and published just this year, a book I need to read because I haven't kept up with everything Kurt's written. It's impossible to keep up with it. Democracy's Resilience to Populism Threat, a book that's probably directly relevant to our discussion today. Professor Kurt Wayland, Kurt, thanks for joining us today.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Jeremi Suri","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1#t=23,202"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Yeah, thank you for having me.

So it was a democracy, but it was ossified and corrupt. So that allowed for the rise of Hugo ChÃ¡vez, who was military nationalist, who had actually made a coup attempt against that ossified democracy, but to then took the electoral route, and due to vast popular discontent, he was swept into office in the landslide in 1998 and he started as a democratically elected leader, but he is a populist, and populists want power, and they want more power, and they want to stay in power for a long time. And so Hugo ChÃ¡vez immediately transformed the institutions to concentrate more power to get control of the legislature, soon, pack the courts, push the opposition aside. So what Hugo ChÃ¡vez did he transfer? He used his democratically elected position to transform Venezuela gradually, slowly, into what we call a soft authoritarian regime. And I say soft because Hugo ChÃ¡vez was tremendously charismatic. He had an electrifying personality. So Hugo ChÃ¡vez could do this transformation from democracy into authoritarian rule, but not using very much violence and repression at all. So he was illiberal. He was undemocratic. He used his charisma to essentially establish his political hegemony and cement cement his authoritarian regime. But he was not brutal and repressive. Then what happens is that ChÃ¡vez dies an early age of cancer, and he had these charismatic leaders are so full of themselves they don't want to nurture rivals. So he had survived himself, typically, by comparing weaklings and sycophants. And when he was about to die, he nominated one of those weaklings and sycophants, NicholÃ¡s Maduro, as his successor. So then Maduro comes in, has an authoritarian regime, but doesn't have the charismatic authority and popular support of Hugo ChÃ¡vez. So soon, Maduro faces opposition challenges. What do you do if you have an authoritarian regime, you don't have a lot of popular support, you use your control of the military and you crack down. And so Maduro cracked down hard in 2014 against opposition protests. He cracked down again in 2017 he cracked down in 2019 so what he did is he transformed Hugo ChÃ¡vez's soft authoritarian regime into a harsh, repressive dictatorship. By the way, much, much Hyser than Victor OrbÃ¡n's in Hungary. So Orban still has a soft authoritarian regime. Venezuela has turned into a really repressive dictatorship. So these dictatorships, they don't they don't respect elections. They still hold elections to have a window dressing because they claim to have to be democratic. But they do whatever they can, ban opposition politicians. Make life hard for the opposition, control the airwaves, spent tremendously before the election, so Hugo ChÃ¡vez, NicolÃ¡s Maduro, got himself re-elected in 2018 in a complete sham election that the opposition boycotted, but the opposition has no leverage against him. Protests don't work. International pressure hasn't worked, so the opposition decided this time, when Maduro came up for re-election, to challenge him in the election, thinking that the time was right for a change, because at the same time that Maduro transformed Venezuela into a brutal dictatorship, he has also ruined the economy. I mean rowing, there hasn't been a country suffering so badly outside of war, than Venezuela. Venezuela, in the last 20 years has seen its GDP drop by 75% I'm talking about 75% which is a tremendous collapse, 75% so about three or four years ago, when the economy hit, worked. Autumn, about 80, 90% of the population lived in poverty. 8 million Venezuelans have left the country in despair, and so I mean, has done total mismanagement, but holding this election, the opposition thought they could finally make dent, and opinion polls showed overwhelming support for the opposition, very low support for Maduro. The exit polls show overwhelming support for the opposition, so they clearly, clearly won, but Maduro, for reasons that I can explain later, Maduro just simply claims to have won, sits there, has support from the military, has taken over all the institutions and justice I won, and the opposition can claim whatever they want, the international community can demand whatever they want. I'll just keep governing.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Kurt Weyland","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Nicolas Maduro","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Hugo Chavez","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Military","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1#t=347,651"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Kurt, that's a incredibly helpful overview, and I'm amazed at how much you were able to pack into that one answer that really helps us understand the rise of what was first a populist authoritarian regime and what now sounds like almost an Orwellian nightmare, is dictatorship which is obviously destroying the country, and it also helps to explain the incredibly large number of Venezuelan refugees coming to the United States, for example. Why did Maduro hold this election? It was clear he was going to lose.

When you go back and you mentioned my inter-war book in the inter-war years, authoritarian rulers were happy to call themselves dictators, and they were proud that they are dictators. But after the Second World War, dictatorship hasn't been that cool anymore, and especially after the end of the Cold War, when the United States in the 1990s had tremendous global hegemony and pushed countries to become liberal and democratic. Nowadays, it's not cool anymore not to hold elections. So virtually every country in the world holds elections, and a lot of these elections are complete sham. The incumbent wins by 98% of the vote. But the old elections say, oh, you know, we have a democratic facade. And I think that is especially the case in cases where authoritarian regime emerges fairly gradually from a democracy. I mean, there wasn't a military coup, you know, right now I'm down in Chile, when in Chile there was a military coup. Dictator Pinochet closed elections. I just want to do as a military dictator. But if you are populist leader who transforms his country from a democracy into an authoritarian regime, you don't want to cancel elections and then suddenly become a dictator. You try, and if you're ChÃ¡vez, you have a lot of popularity, you think you can win all these elections, and you maintain elections. It's not cool not to have elections, especially in the Western Hemisphere, under the nose of the United States, in a region that in 2001 adopted a Democratic Charter that the region committed to democracy. And so you claim against all evidence that this is democratic, and this is democratic, and you all the elections, and then you try to manipulate the stage. You mentioned the banning of the main opposition candidate. You try to manipulate things in all kinds of ways so that somehow or other, you think he might be able to eke out victory. I don't know what Maduro thought, whether he thought somehow his manipulations would allow him to achieve some kind of shame victory, or whether he just thought, it doesn't matter, but not holding elections, it's just not legit anymore.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Kurt Weyland","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Nicolas Maduro","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Hugo Chavez","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Military","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1#t=705,844"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"And, Kurt, did, did Maduro think he would win?

We don't have access to the inner, innner workings of the Maduro regime. We don't know some of these, some of these dictators are really quite united and believe their own propaganda. I mean, what is interesting and what I honestly do not understand, while Maduro outlawed the main opposition candidate and created all kinds of trouble for the opposition, and imprisoned opposition leaders, left and right and all the kind of thing. He allowed opinion polls to go forward, and every single credible opinion poll showed like the vote preference of 70% For the opposition and 25% for Maduro. So if so, I would find it kind of surprising if Maduro didn't know what the population was like. Maybe they thought that by for example, there are rumors that do it on election day, they created trouble for people to vote, especially opposition neighborhoods, you know, long lines and very slow movement, and whereas in their own neighborhoods, you know, so they maybe they thought, in just manipulating the voting process or that they could somehow others manipulate ballot boxes, that they would come up with the result. It's hard to know what exactly is going on, but, but what I frankly, wonder is whether Maduro just thought the result doesn't matter. I mean, he said before the election, the famous quote, I'll win by hook or crook. It doesn't matter. You know, this way or other. And so these dictators, you know, he knew that he had a lot of support from the military, which is absolutely decisive, for reasons that I can explain. And so in some sense, it doesn't matter to him what the election result is. He just sits there, protected by the military, knows he will stay in power. The domestic opposition can shout and yell. The international community can make pressure. He has enough support from China, Russia, Iran, and he'll just sit there. He sits on oil, so he has some economic lifeline and election result in some basic sense, doesn't matter that much to him.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Kurt Weyland","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Nicolas Maduro","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Foreign Relations","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Military","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1#t=861,996"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"It's a terrible situation.

Because if you're under an authoritarian regime, you don't have procedural, institutional legitimacy, and so you need, ultimately, the capacity to rely on coercion if there's problem, if there is protests, you need to have the capacity to clamp down. Now, front line of that is the police and these paramilitaries that they have in these paramilitary gangs that they have in Venezuela. But ultimately, when push comes to shove, it depends on the military. The military is the mainstay of every single authoritarian regime, the Ultima ratio. So and Maduro has that military support for the same reason that Maduro feels compelled to stay in power, which is the following. During his 11 years as a dictator, Maduro has committed a bunch of human rights violations. He has ensured military loyalty by allowing the military to engage in large scale corruption, contraband. The military and Maduro are involved in international drug trafficking. Two of Maduro's nephews were apprehended in 2015 for involvement in drug trafficking. So the whole clique in power, Maduro, his political support, his narrow aids and the military, which is the mainstay, they're all essentially a crime cartel mafia and so the problem is the international community has become legalized. The international community says we don't accept corruption. We don't accept human rights violations anymore. And so the international community has threatened to indict Maduro and a whole bunch of his underlings for their human rights violations, for their corruption, for their involvement in drug trafficking, not only the US, but also the International Criminal Court. And so that whole mafia in power essentially feels compelled to stay in power, because if they were to lose power, they go to jail, to jail. And you see the international presidents. When the president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernandez, stepped down in 2022 within three weeks, he was in chains and extradited to the United States. And so that's what Maduro and all the main generals fear. If they lose power, they're going to go to jail forever, and so that's the reason why they cling to power, regardless of what happens. And by Maduro can be assured of military support. They all, you know this saying they all have to hang together so that they don't hang separately.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Kurt Weyland","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Nicolas Maduro","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Military","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1#t=1005,1179"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Right, right.

Hugo ChÃ¡vez took on an ossified elitist democracy and claimed to do things for poorer people. And given that, Hugo ChÃ¡vez benefited from the global commodities boom, he rolled over one a bunch of social programs, you know, he tried to advance popular health care, literacy campaigns, all these kinds of things. So some people benefited from ChÃ¡vez, and ChÃ¡vez was highly revered, and some of that still persists. But I think the main support for my guru is essentially people who are utterly dependent upon him. Every person who works in the vastly swelled public administration has to promise support to Maduro, otherwise they lose their job. And what Maduro has done, he has devilishly taken advantage of the terrible crisis that he helped to create by using a program of distribution of food packages to the poor who have nothing to eat, and controls that through a surveillance system to essentially say you only eat if you support me. And so when you see now people protesting in favor of Maduro, a lot of those are essentially bought lackeys. And so that is also, you know, there is the regime holds a whole bunch of people hostage, because if you don't vote, and people probably fear if they vote, they have to vote for Maduro, you don't vote, you don't eat. So that's the domestic support. So So is that voluntary? Autonomous? Probably not. I think a lot of that is coerced and dependent internationally. Unfortunately, as I said, I'm down in Chile and I was recently in Brazil, a number of left wingers still have this sort of strange ideological affinity. So the Chilean Communist Party has recognized the Venezuelan election, and Maduro has reelected the Brazilian Workers Party, the Workers Party of President Lula in Brazil, which rose under an authoritarian regime and was very important for Brazil's democratization, the Workers Party of Brazil has recognized Maduro's victory to be out of that kind of misunderstood ideological affinity. So there's this left-wing thing like, Oh yeah, you know, he's kind of bad, but he still is a left winger, and we need to support him, and also driven a little by anti-Americanism. So So you have this strange kind of sort of support for a left winger that leaves democracy out of the picture.

I mean, there is a very well organized opposition, courageous, an opposition that was able to bring out a lot of voters, and also, as you said, the economy in Venezuela, despite Venezuela having more oil resources than any other country in the world, more oil than Saudi Arabia, even, nonetheless, this country is starving because of the mismanagement and the corruption and the International sanctions.

I admire their courage in protesting, but I do not think that they have the cloud by far domestically to really do something. And the international community, the international community, of course, is divided, as I mentioned. Maduro, has support from the kind of bad axis of China and Russia and Iran and whatever Western countries, many countries have not recognized the result of the election, and they're pushing for Venezuela to make transparent the voting process and to negotiate and all this kind of thing. And Maduro just doesn't do it, you know. So here, in some sense, surprisingly, a group of left-wing governments in Latin America, led by Luna da Silva, who, as president, although his party recognized the election as President, hasn't done it. Gustavo Pedro of Mexico and of Colombia, sorry, and then AMLO of Mexico, they have all pushed Venezuela to make the Election Results transparent, and Maduro says, yeah, and maybe not, and maybe whatever, and just doesn't do it.

I mean, the country, the country's economy, is going terribly, but oil gives it a little bit of a lifeline, and Maduro doesn't care. I mean, what does Maduro care? Sitting in his palace surrounded by military people who are compelled to support him, if 80% of the population starve, I mean, it just doesn't and what can the international community do? The United States has imposed sanctions. Doesn't do any good, because countries like China, Russia, Iran, enable Maduro to evade sanctions to a good extent.

And he was very close to Fidel Castro of Cuba, and Cuba sent 2,000 intelligence agents that essentially helped ChÃ¡vez purge the military and install an internal surveillance and control system that was very strong and very effective. And so they essentially the military, I mean Maduro is aware that the only real threat he would face would be from the defection of military. And so they try to prevent it at all cost. Through surveillance, through harsh crack downs, through purges, I mean, there are a lot of stories that military people who showed some sign of disloyalty are being tortured, are being killed. So so coercion has enabled him to keep military loyalty. The second thing is the following. What is the situation in which lower level military people defect? Essentially, if you have sustained mass protests that get suppressed with large-scale violence, and it goes on and on and on. And then at some point or other, members of the military might say, I don't wanna I don't wanna do this anymore. But in some sense, you know, and I don't know how to say that, fortunately or unfortunately, from the perspective of what we are saying, unfortunately, there were large-scale protests in Venezuela for two, three days. Then it died down because the repression was effective. And so two, three days, you know, you crack down. Yes. You you imprison 2,000 people. You kill a bunch of people. It wasn't sustained enough, and it wasn't broad enough. And when you see where the so, like, the recent opposition protest last Saturday was in the eastern part of Caracas, which is a middle class neighborhood. If the protests had led to a mass outpouring of popular protests some some popular neighborhoods like Petare protested, but the whole western part of Caracas is the real stronghold of Chavista support. And there wasn't very much protest going on there if there had been really massive outpouring. If it hadn't only been, know, predominantly educated middle class people, but if there had been, you know, millions of poor Venezuelans just pouring down from the slums and hills and poor neighborhoods of Caracas into the city center, besieging the Presidential Palace. If there have been a real kind of popular assault on the regime and that had gone on and then there had been just killing, killing, killing, killing, then you might have seen defection. But but the regime managed very quickly to contain and suppress the protests and confine them primarily to the middle-class areas, and that is just simply not enough to prompt large-scale military defection.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Kurt Weyland","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Nicolas Maduro","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Hugo Chavez","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Military","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1#t=1806,2003"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Well, that's a that's a very compelling, if sad, answer.

I think it's a reminder of how important it is to engage with and reckon with the real conditions on the ground at the very least.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zachary Suri","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1#t=2250,2290"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"I agree, and and I think Kurt has quite brilliantly laid out for us in his work and in the discussion here an important research agenda, a research agenda not just for scholars like Kurt and myself, but for for all kinds of citizens, which is thinking through what are the options, what are the things the international community can and cannot do. And I would just highlight a point that Kurt made, which is that, in some ways, the efforts to hold appropriately leaders accountable for their crimes, and in theory, I'm certainly for that, but that effort often makes it harder to get them to leave power. And if our goal as supporters of democracy in a broad sense is about getting dictators out and nondictators in and building institutions, it's probably time we think through a little more, in a more sophisticated way how to do that. It it it seems as if the dictators are ahead of us in our thinking about international democracy and international democratic procedures. Is that a fair note to close on, Kurt?

I think the international community has to face up to that terrible paradox that this legalization of international affairs has this unintended side effect. And I do not know what could be done to, you know I mean, I made the joke about Saint Helena. There would have to be some kinda international safe haven, some way of sort of emergency amnesty, whatever, and it would have to be credible and enforced by the international community, unfortunately, limiting that international regime of prosecuting violators of human rights and other norms in order to I mean, not only induce, but allow them to step down from power. I mean and how to do that? Man, that is a very, very difficult how to build an international regime in a world that is so divided between the democratic forces that are on the defensive now and sort of ascending authoritarian forces of China and Russia and Iran, whatever. I do not know how that could be done, but it's an urgent agenda.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Kurt Weyland","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Foreign Relations","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1#t=2357,2422"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://raymondhyser.github.io/venezuelaelections/episode_273_venezuela_elections_with_professor_kurt_weyland/canvas/1/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Yes. And, of course, even your joke about Saint Helena points to another problem. When Napoleon was sent to Saint Helena, first of all, he wasn't happy to be there, and then in the end, he was poisoned because they were fearful. The European states said he would come back again, which is always the concern if you if you let these people go to a Saint Helena, that they'll just return. Kurt Weyland, thank you so much for joining us today, for sharing, really, I think, compelling, if quite depressing, insights into Venezuela and and I think the larger challenge of dictatorship and coup proofing regimes in in various places around the world. Venezuela is just one of the worst examples, but there are many others. I encourage our listeners to read Kurt's work. It's really eye opening in its depth and its comparative, breadth.
