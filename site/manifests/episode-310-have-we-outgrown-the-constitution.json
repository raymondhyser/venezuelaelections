Why is that? So, why, why, why wouldn’t the opposite argument, the one that I think I’ve often made be true, which is the way I think of Madison’s argument on pluralism, that being large and being unbound. It means that, as we did throughout the 19th century, you know, you can add two new territories, one for one side, one Democratic, one Democratic territory, one wig or Republican territory.

I don’t think he thought that this extension he was thinking of, of geographical extensions, but think about extensions of democracy itself, of the inclusion of previously excluded groups.

Uh, and then later in the 20th century you get Sheldon Wolin, who tells us that democracy is in, is inherently transgressive. It’s inherently challenging the constraints, uh, and structures that. Define what a constitution is, which is a system of constraints, a structure of constraints, that democracy is constantly challenging. Those constraints and that constitutions are inherently regimes that, uh, a particular set of, uh, democratic participants agrees, will secure their interests, then that democracy, uh, in a kind of dialectical fashion develops, outgrows those arrangements and needs to challenge them and constrain them.
